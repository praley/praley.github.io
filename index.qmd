# Hi 👋 I'm Chris.

I'm a social scientist and data analytics leader based in Brooklyn, NY.

**📊 You can find my work [here](projects)**. My research is focused on the mechanisms of how culture and public policy inform and shape one another. Some examples include, but are not limited to: analyzing the domino effect among book banning policies, understanding the impact of evacuation among Peace Corps volunteers, and even taking a quantitative look at Playboy content over time.

**💼 You can see my resume [here](resume.html)**. I've worked across local, state, and federal government agencies in the US. I've spent the last few years leading analytics teams at a few tech companies.

🧑🏻‍🏫️ I am also currently pursuing graduate studies at NYU Steinhardt, where I also support the [Queer Data Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/queer_data_lab/) and teach some Statistics-related courses. I'm originally from Severna Park, a town in between Baltimore and Annapolis, MD. I have also lived in Chicago, Oaxaca, DC, San Francisco, and New York. In my spare time, I like to cook for my friends, and I am learning how to quilt.
