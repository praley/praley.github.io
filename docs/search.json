    "text": "Hi üëã I‚Äôm Chris.\nI‚Äôm a social scientist and data analytics leader based in Brooklyn, NY.\nüìä You can find my work here. My research is focused on the mechanisms of how culture and public policy inform and shape one another. Some examples include, but are not limited to: analyzing the domino effect among book banning policies, understanding the impact of evacuation among Peace Corps volunteers, and even taking a quantitative look at Playboy content over time.\nüíº You can see my resume here. I‚Äôve worked across local, state, and federal government agencies in the US. I‚Äôve also spent the last few years in analytics at a few tech companies. Please reach out if you are interested in learning more.\nI am also currently pursuing graduate studies at NYU Steinhardt, where I also support the Queer Data Lab and teach some Statistics-related courses. I‚Äôm originally from Severna Park, a town in between Baltimore and Annapolis, MD. I have also lived in Chicago, Oaxaca, DC, San Francisco, and New York. In my spare time, I like to cook for friends, and I am learning how to quilt."
